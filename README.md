Intent-driven app assembly on Solana. Infrastructure that survives.

## ⚡ Install

```bash
npm install -g forge-sdk-solana
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Initialize a project
```bash
forge init my-project
cd my-project
```

### Check status
```bash
forge status
```

### Deploy to Solana
```bash
forge deploy
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Rust** 1.70+
- **Solana CLI** (latest)
- **Anchor CLI** 0.29.0

## 🎯 What FORGE Does

FORGE generates production-ready Anchor programs from intent. It creates the boilerplate so you focus on business logic.

- ✅ Generates complete Anchor workspace
- ✅ Creates Cargo.toml with proper dependencies
- ✅ Sets up lib.rs with Anchor framework
- ✅ Configures Anchor.toml for deployment
- ✅ Works with real Solana networks

## 🚫 What FORGE Does NOT Do

FORGE does not:
- Host your code
- Manage your keys
- Abstract blockchain risks
- Hold your hand

If you want magic, look elsewhere.

## 📚 Requirements

You must have:
- Basic Rust knowledge
- Understanding of Solana concepts
- Your own wallet and keys
- Test SOL for deployment

## 🔧 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `forge init <name>` | Create new Anchor project |
| `forge status` | Check environment and tools |
| `forge deploy` | Deploy program to Solana |

## 📖 Examples

```bash
# Create a token program
forge init my-token

# Check everything is ready
forge status

# Deploy to devnet
forge deploy
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
FORGE CLI (npm)
├── forge-sdk-solana - Node.js CLI tool
└── forge-runtime - Rust runtime (crates.io)

Both work together for complete Solana development
```

## 🐛 Support

This is infrastructure. If it breaks:
1. File an issue on GitHub
2. Include your `forge status` output
3. Describe what you expected vs what happened

If you don't understand Solana, learn Solana first.
